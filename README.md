## Naming of Files
Camelcase no spaces/underscores.\
Must accurately describe the goal of the file/class.

## Setup Instructions
1. Unzip the Elevator System project onto your local machine.\
2. Open the unzipped folder in eclipse\
3. Navigate to "Simulation.java"\
4. From there, you will find the main method at the bottom of the class.\
5. Press run and the program will execute

## Testing Instructions
1. Unzip the Elevator System project onto your local machine.\
2. Open the unzipped folder in eclipse\
3. Navigate to the folder that will offer the test you wish to execute. All unit test files start with lowercase "test".\
4. Pressing run while within the class will execute the tests.

Executing the main within the Simulation class will read in the test events for the program from Events.txt

## Test files used
Included within the zipped eclipse project is a text file named <b>Events.txt</b>. This file includs the formatted events\
which are read into the program at the start. It is already in the correct location for testing purposes.
